# 👋 Hi, I’m Tulsi Basetti

🎓 I’m a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about **AI, Machine Learning, and NLP**.  
🧠 I love building end-to-end ML pipelines and experimenting with deep learning models.  
📚 Currently exploring advanced topics like BERT, LSTMs.

💡 I’m looking to collaborate on real-world AI projects, internships, or open-source ML tools.
